## Introduction:
Our project, inspired by the theme "uncovering a new leaf" üçÉ, presents a Discord bot designed to usher in a fresh approach to studying. Recognizing the challenges that students and learners face in managing their time, sourcing study materials, and retaining information, we have integrated features such as Pomodoro timers, YouTube video audio streaming for educational content, text-to-speech functionality, and reminder systems. By simply using commands prefixed with '!', users can revamp their study habits, and turn over a new leaf in their academic journey üìö.

## Features:

### 1. Pomodoro Timer:
   - Use the bot for effective time management by setting study and break intervals.
   - Command: `!pomodoro <study_time> <break_time>` to start the timer (`<study_time>` and `<break_time>` are in minutes)
   - Stop the timer anytime with `!stop`.
   

### 2. YouTube Video Summarizer:
   - YouTube videos are a great way to turn over a new leaf by learning a new skill, get a concise summary of a YouTube video by providing its link.
   - Using OpenAI's API and YouTube Transcript API, the bot summarizes the video and sends it to the user.
   - Command: `!youtube <youtube_url>`.

### 3. Voice Channel Audio Playback (WIP):
   - The bot can join a voice channel and play audio from a YouTube video.
   - Commands: `!join` to join a voice channel, and `!playaudio <youtube_url>` to play the YouTube video's audio.

### 4. Reminders:
   - Cultivate your memory by sowing tasks and nurturing their growth until the deadline üçÇ
   - Commands: `!remind <task_name> <duration_in_seconds>` to set a reminder.
   - complete a task using `!completeTask <task-code>`

   ```
   !remind leetcode 900 // set task leetcode due in 15 minutes
   !tasks // list out tasks and their task-code
   !completeTask leetcode-##### // mark task as completed
   !cancel leetcode-##### // cancel task
   ```


### 5. Greet All Members:
   - A fun command that greets all members in a guild with customized greetings for specific members.
   - Command: `!greet_all`.

... and many more to come!
